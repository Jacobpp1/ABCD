Integrating a unit circle with 1000000 points. Should give PI. Integral is: 3.140076

Integrating three functions:
Circle which is just the unit circle integrated from -1 to 1 for both x and y.
A 2D-Gaussian which is 0.1*e^(-x^2/8 - y^2/2), integrated from -5 to 5 for both x and y
And 'Oscillating' which is Cos(x-1)*Sin(y), integrated from -1 to 0.5 for x and 0 to 1 for y

Seems to generally follow 1/sqrt(n) as expected

Solving integral given in problem A with 1e7 points gives: 1.39246128153987Â±0.00293033241800857
Should be 1.3932039296856768591842462603255

Comparing errors between plain and quasi MC, using 1e8 points:
For circle integral, plain error is 0.000164209169062838, and quasi is 2.00000000116773E-07
For Gaussian integral, plain error is 0.000217735251842442, and quasi is 7.28213175094083E-07
For oscillating integral, plain error is 3.22941223645749E-05, and quasi is 3.43723054296863E-07
So the error seems to generally be a couple of orders of magnitude better using the quasi-random method

To investigate how the error scales with number of points, I now just integrate the circle.

Results are shown in figure 'B_err_plot.svg'. Now with log10 of errors also.
Seems to have the same slope for both methods, but more precise using quasi method.
