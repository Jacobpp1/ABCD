A)
Linear splines
Since it is linear spline, the integral should be the same as summing over the intervals
Integrating sin(x)*x from 0 to 5
Increase number of datapoints in code (array_size variable) for better precision of integration
Integral of sin(x)*x, linear: -2.37435174020511
Summing method integral: -2.37435174020511

Checking qspline against 3 functions
For a constant function y=1, we expect no parameters, since y[i] is unchanging
b0=0	c0=0
b1=0	c1=0
b2=0	c2=0
b3=0	c3=0
For a linear function y=x, we expect only linear terms added on, so c[i]=0 always
b0=1	c0=0
b1=1	c1=0
b2=1	c2=0
b3=1	c3=0
For a constant function y=x^2, we expect both parameters to vary
b0=1	c0=2
b1=5	c1=0
b2=5	c2=2
b3=9	c3=0
